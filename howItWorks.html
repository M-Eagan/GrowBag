<h1>How It Works</h1>

<h2>Growing your Vegetables</h2>
    <p class="how-it-works">Fill your Vegetable Grow Bag with three inches of nutrient-dense soil.  Plant your vegetable and cover with an inch of soil.  
        Roll the top of your Vegetable Grow Bag so it is only 4 inches above the soil.  Water thoroughly and place vegatables in direct sunlight.</p>
    <p  class ="how-it-works">As your vegetbles begin to sprout unroll the top of the bag and cover them with more dirt.  Open the side flap to monitor vegetable development and harvest once they are fully grown. 
        The flap allows the gardener to harvest the vegetables as they are ready instead of waiting until the end of the season and possibly wasting harvest yield.</p>
